# What's Beehive?

[Beehive]() is a nonprofit, open source initiative launched by former United Nations staff bringing humanitarian organizations, tech volunteers and supporters together to vastly improve humanitarian crowdfunding.

**We're challenging ourselves to**:

- Build the backend architecture needed to power tomorrow's intelligent, data-driven humanitarian crowdfunding applications

- Solve and model how best-in-class humanitarian crowdfunding applications can function and serve the professional humanitarian community
