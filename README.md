#Beehive

[Beehive](http://beehive.ngo) is a **nonprofit**, **open source** initiative launched by former United Nations staff to **solve** and **model** how to vastly improve **humanitarian financing** at the crowdunding level.

Beehive is concentrating on bringing humanitarian organizations, tech volunteers and supporters together to:

- Build the backend architecture needed to power next-generations, open data driven humanitarian crowdfunding applications
- Advance, influence and support the development of new humanitarain crowdfunding applicaions through building and operating our own

##Focuses

The United Nations and government development are pushing humanitarian organizations to publish detailed, machine readable information about their aid activities, transactions and results using **IATI**, an open data sharing framework created by the [International Aid Transparency Initiative](http://iatistandard.org) and for third parties to develop IATI applications incentivizing reporting and improving coordination between organizations and donors (like [Cordaid](https://www.cordaid.org/en/projects/), [D-portal](http://d-portal.org/) and [Open.UNDP](http://open.undp.org/#2016)).

Beehive is concentrating on:

- Building the **backend architecture** required to make it possible for developers to easily setup and reliably operate at scale innovative applications powered by IATI data

- Building a whole new generation of intelligent, IATI data-driven humanitarian crowdfunding applications optimized to serve the professional humanitarian communityâ€™s real-time operational fundraising needs
