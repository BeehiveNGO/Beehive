**Beehive** is a **nonprofit**, **open source initiative** launched by former United Nations staff, inspired by [Atom](http://atom.io), [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/), [PubNub](https://www.pubnub.com) and [openCypher](http://www.opencypher.org/).

Beehive is bringing humanitarian organizations, tech volunteers and supporters together to build the worldâ€™s first open-sourced, open-data-driven **humanitarian crowdfunding platform** and the **backend architecture**, **software frameworks** and **database query  commands** developers need to setup, power and scale next-generation, intelligent, open-data-driven humanitarian crowdfunding applications serving the professional humanitarian community.
