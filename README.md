##Focus

Beehive team members are principally working on building the worldâ€™s first open source, open-data-driven **humanitarian crowdfunding platform** and the **backend architecture** and **software frameworks** that developers need to setup, power and scale next generation, [IATI](https://github.com/BeehiveNGO/Beehive/wiki/IATI) compliant humanitarian crowdfunding applications.

##Projects and Labs

The initiative is organized around community [Projects](https://github.com/BeehiveNGO/Beehive/wiki/Project-List) and [Labs](https://github.com/BeehiveNGO/Beehive/wiki/Labs).
