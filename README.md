#Beehive

**Beehive** is a **nonprofit**, **open source initiative** launched by former United Nations staff that's bringing humanitarian organizations, tech volunteers and supporters together to **solve** and **model** how to vastly improve **humanitarian financing technology** at the **crowdfunding level**.

Beehive team members are currently building the worldâ€™s first open source, open-data-driven **humanitarian crowdfunding platform** and the **backend architecture** and **software frameworks** that developers need to setup, power and scale next generation, [IATI](http://iatistandard.org) compliant humanitarian crowdfunding applications.
