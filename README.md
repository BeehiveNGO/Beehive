##Focus

Beehive is concentrating on building the backend architecture develoopers need to setup and operate next-generation, data-driven humanitarian crowdfunding applications and on solving and modeling how they can effectively serve the professional humanitarian community.

##Project Folders

Currently we're working on five website projects:

- [Beehive.ngo](): Release version humanitarian crowdfunding platform
- [Beta.beehive.ngo](): Beta platform used to showcase and test new features 
- [App_engine](): Beta platform powered by Google App Engine used to test our database
- [HXS.ngo](): Landing page and access point for Beehive's Humanitarian Data Exchange Server
- [ReliefBot.io](): Experimental space we're using to engineer how bots can use data sourced from the humanitarian community to answer queries about how to support humanitarian operations

##Supporters

Beehive is supported by a growing network of innovative technology companies:

[Salesforce](), Box, DatabaseLabs
