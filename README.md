#[Beehive](http://beehivengo.github.io/Beehive/) - Open Source Humanitarian Crowdfunding Initiative

Beehive is an outgrowth of a United Nations conceived micro-grants program that was shelved in early development then restarted outside of the UN and turned into an open source initiative bringing humanitarian organizations, tech volunteers and supporters together to **solve** and **model** how to vastly improve humanitarian crowdfunding.

##Focus

**IATI** is an open data sharing standard and framework for aid activity reporting used by over 450 humanitarian and development organizations created by the [International Aid Transperancy Initiative](http://iatistandard.org). IATI makes detailed information on aid activities, transactions and results transparent and accessible to machine applications like [Cordaid](http://www.aidtransparency.net/news/cordaids-new-interactive-map-is-powered-by-iati-data) and [Open Aid Search](http://www.openaidsearch.org/).

**Next-generation** humanitarian crowdfunding applications like [RSR.Akvo](http://rsr.akvo.org/en/projects/) use data sourced from channels like IATI to inform giving, improving coordination between organizations and donors. **Beehive** is focusing on building the backend architecture needed to power innovative new humanitarian crowdfunding applications operating at scale and modeling how they can serve the humanitarian community.
