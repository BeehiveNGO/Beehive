**Beehive** is an all-volunteer, open source initiative launched by former United Nations staff. The initiative is taking responsibility for bringing humanitarian organizations, tech volunteers and supporters together to vastly improve humanitarian financing technology at the crowdfunding level. 

Beehive is a nonprofit program of [Empowerment Works](http://www.empowermentworks.org/) (501c3: 31-1796801). Learn more: [Beehive Slide Deck](https://www.slideshare.net/BrentOPhillips/more-about-beehive)

## Focus

The humanitarian community has been working concertedly to setup technical frameworks like [IATI]() for organizations to use to openly share detailed aid activity information and make the information accessible to machine applications.

Beehive team members are focusing on establishing the backend architecture, software frameworks and technical knowhow developers need to build, power and scale intelligent, enterprise-grade, IATI-data-driven applications and on building and operating prototype applications modeling how open data streaming between organizations can be plugged into and employed to improve coordination between organizations and donors.

## Supporters

The initiative is supported by a growing network of innovative startups and leading technology companies:
