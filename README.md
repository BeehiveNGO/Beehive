#Beehive

[Beehive](http://beehive.ngo) is a nonprofit, open source initiative launched by former United Nations staff bringing humanitarian organizations, tech volunteers and supporters together to vastly improve **humanitarian financing technology** and **applications** at the **crowdfunding level**.

#Focuses

Beehive is concentrating on:
- Setting up the **backend architecture** and **frameworks** developers need to build, power and scale next-generation, intelligent, open data driven humanitarian crowdfunding applications

- **Solving** and **modeling** how tomorrow's humanitarian crowdfunding applications can optimally serve the professional humanitarain community today

##Background

The United Nations and government development are pushing humanitarian organizations to publish detailed, machine readable information about their aid activities, transactions and results using **IATI**, an open data sharing framework created by the [International Aid Transparency Initiative](http://iatistandard.org) and for third parties to develop IATI applications incentivizing reporting and improving coordination between organizations and donors (like [Cordaid](https://www.cordaid.org/en/projects/), [D-portal](http://d-portal.org/) and [Open.UNDP](http://open.undp.org/#2016)).
