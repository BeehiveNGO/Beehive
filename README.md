#What's Beehive?

[Beehive](http://beehive.ngo) is a **nonprofit**, **open source** initiative launched by former United Nations staff. We're bringing humanitarian organizations, tech volunteers and supporters together to work on **vastly improving humanitarian crowdfunding**.

##Focus

Beehive is concentrating on building the **backend architecture** developers need to setup and operate next-generation, data-driven humanitarian crowdfunding applications and on **solving** and **modeling** how intelligent humanitarian crowdfunding applications, powered by IATI data, can effectively work and serve the professional humanitarian community.

**IATI** is an open data sharing standard and framework over 500 humanitarian and development organization use to share comparable, machine readable information on aid activities, transactions and results, created by the [International Aid Transparency Initiative](http://iatistandard.org).

##Project Folders

Currently we're working on five website projects:

- [Beehive.ngo](): Release version humanitarian crowdfunding platform
- [Beta.beehive.ngo](): Beta platform used to showcase and test new features 
- [App_engine](): Beta platform powered by Google App Engine used to test our database
- [HXS.ngo](): Landing page and access point for Beehive's Humanitarian Data Exchange Server
- [ReliefBot.io](): Experimental space we're using to engineer how bots can use data sourced from the humanitarian community to answer queries about how to support humanitarian operations

##Supporters
