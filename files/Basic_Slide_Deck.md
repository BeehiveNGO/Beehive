# About Beehive - Four Slides
Beehive is a nonprofit, open source initiative launched by former United Nations staff bringing together humanitarian organizations, tech volunteers and supporters to tackle how to vastly improve humanitarian crowdfunding and bring IATI compliant aid activity reporting down to the crowdfunding level.
### IATI Open Data Sharing
IATI is an open data sharing standard and framework for aid activity reporting used by over 450 humanitarian and development organizations, created by the [International Aid Transparency Initiative](http://iatistandard.org). IATI makes detailed information on aid activities, transactions and results transparent and accessible to machine applications.

### Data-driven Crowdfunding
Future crowdfunding platforms will mainstream data sourced from channels like IATI to inform giving and compete to serve the humanitarian community in new and innovative ways. But presently IATI’s API isn’t adapted to power next-generation humanitarian crowdfunding applications.
