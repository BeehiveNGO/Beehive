# IATI Data Extractor

This folder contains build files for Beehive's automated [IATI Data Extractor]() tool.

##Overview

[IATI]() is an open data sharing standard and framework created by the [International Aid Transparency Initiative](http://iatistandard.org). Over 500 humanitarian and development organizations are using IATI to share detailed, machine readable information about their aid activities. To publish to IATI, organizations convert aid activity information into XML, host the files on their servers and sent metadata on the files to IATI.
