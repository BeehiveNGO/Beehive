#HXQL - Humanitarian Exchange Query Language

**IATI** is an open data sharing standard and framework for aid activity reporting used by over humanitarian and development organizations, created by the [International Aid Transparency Initiative](http://iatistandard.org). Beehive is creating a [Humanitarian Data Exchange Server](https://github.com/BeehiveNGO/Beehive/wiki/Humanitarian-Exchange-Server) (HXS) next-generation, intelligent, open-data-driven humanitarian crowdfunding applications can use to access IATI's data stream.

To suppoty and facilitate applications development and to make using Beehive's HXS easier, Beehive is also establishing a Humanitarian Exchange Query Language or [HXQL](https://github.com/BeehiveNGO/Beehive/wiki/HXQL).
